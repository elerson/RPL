To use the code you need:
	*A MSP430 device with at least 512bytes of RAM and 8kbytes ROM (the implementation uses 370bytes, but the memory size is power of 2)
	*A Breakout board to connect the MSP430 launchpad to a zigbee.(The project is available at hardwareProject directory)
	*For the msp430: The Code Composer Studio IDE(http://www.ti.com/tool/ccstudio) 
	*For the sink: Qt (http://qt-project.org/downloads)
